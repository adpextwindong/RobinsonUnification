# A Machine-Oriented Logic Based on the Resolution Principle

"A Machine-Oriented Logic Based on the Resolution Principle" by J. A. Robinson typeset in LaTeX.

The [pdfs](http://web.stanford.edu/class/linguist289/robinson65.pdf) avalible [online](http://ropas.snu.ac.kr/lib/dock/Ro1965.pdf) are extremely hard on the eyes. This repo is for the sake of preservation.

## Missing

Page 12 on the linked pdf's is slightly cut off on the right side. Currently that typeseting has been postponed until I can find a better scan.

## Contributing

Pull requests for typos and other fixes welcome.
